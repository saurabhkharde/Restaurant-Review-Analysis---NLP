# Restaurant-Review-Analysis
It is a simple project to understand how to clean and predict the positive and negative reviews of the restaurant from the dataset.
This project has a Dataset file with 1000 reviews of a Restaurant and we are performing Review analysis using Python.
We have used Naive Bayes Algorithm to predict the confusion matrix and used Bag of Words model to clean the data.
